# Nushell Prophet Manuals on Nushell

## About These Manuals

The best place to start learning Nushell is the official [Nushell Book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/)—it's exceptionally well-written, actively maintained, and always up to date.

These manuals serve a different purpose. Unlike the comprehensive Nushell Book, we focus specifically on installation and setup for particular platforms (currently macOS). Each manual includes accompanying video guides and provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for newcomers ("nu-bies") who may find certain setup tasks intimidating.

Many configuration steps that seem obvious to experienced developers can be confusing for beginners. Our goal is to walk you through these steps clearly, providing battle-tested, efficient defaults—though opinionated—so you can get Nushell properly set up and start learning through hands-on experimentation.
