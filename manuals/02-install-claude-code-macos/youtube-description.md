I decided to record this video for our Nushell series, even though it isn't directly related to my Nushell setup. I imagine that Claude Code can really help with possible problems in the terminal in general, and in Nushell in particular. So, here is my version of the video.

First, you'll need to install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download
Then, install Claude Code itself: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup
