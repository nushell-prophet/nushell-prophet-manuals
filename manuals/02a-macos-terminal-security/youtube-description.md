Understand macOS security and safe software installation practices as you learn terminal development! This essential guide helps beginners experiment with confidence while understanding the trust model behind Homebrew, installation scripts, and third-party tools. Full manual link in the description below.

📖 Full manual: https://github.com/nushell-prophet/nushell-prophet-manuals/blob/main/manuals/02a-macos-terminal-security/manual.md

🔧 What You'll Learn:
- How macOS protects your system (SIP, Gatekeeper, sandboxing)
- Understanding software installation risks and the trust-based distribution model
- Security red flags to avoid entirely (disabling SIP, blind sudo, unknown scripts)
- Good security habits for developers
- Why Nushell provides security advantages

💡 Why This Matters:
If you've followed the previous manuals, you've already installed Homebrew, pasted commands from the internet, and executed installation scripts. This is completely normal — but it's worth understanding what these actions mean. This video helps you experiment with your eyes open, not out of fear, but with awareness of calculated risks.

📝 Prerequisites:
- No security expertise needed — designed for absolute beginners
- Particularly relevant if you've followed Manual 01 (Homebrew installation) or Manual 02 (Claude Code installation)
- macOS users (though principles apply broadly)
