## Files

### CLAUDE-CODE-TASK-INSTRUCTIONS.md

## Quick Start

When working on this project:

1. **First time?** Read `CLAUDE-CODE-TASK-INSTRUCTIONS.md` to understand the user's preferences and common workflows
2. **Creating video narration?** Apply rules from `TTS-PREPARATION-RULES.md`
3. **Writing YouTube descriptions?** Follow structure from `YOUTUBE-DESCRIPTION-GUIDELINES.md`
4. **User gives short command?** Check "Quick Reference Commands" section in task instructions

## Integration with CLAUDE.md

The main `CLAUDE.md` in the repository root provides high-level project context. These production docs provide detailed task-specific instructions. Both work together to guide Claude Code's behavior in this project.
