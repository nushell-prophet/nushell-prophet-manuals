# YouTube Description Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for creating YouTube video descriptions for manual tutorials in this repository.

## File Location

Each manual should have its YouTube description stored in:
```
manuals/NN-descriptive-name/youtube-description.md
```

## Structure

A YouTube description should include the following elements:

### 1. Opening Hook (Required)
Start with a compelling 1-2 sentence introduction that:
- Clearly states what the video covers
- Indicates the target audience (e.g., "Perfect for beginners")
- Highlights the value proposition
- Mentions that the full manual link is in the description

Example:
```
Learn how to install and set up Nushell on macOS with this comprehensive
step-by-step tutorial! Perfect for beginners who want to get started with
this modern, powerful shell. Full manual link in the description below.
```

### 2. Full Manual Link (Required)
Place the GitHub manual link immediately after the opening hook using the üìñ emoji:
- This ensures the link is visible before "Show more" on YouTube
- Makes it easy for viewers to follow along with the written manual
- Encourages viewers to read the comprehensive documentation

Example:
```
üìñ Full manual: https://github.com/nushell-prophet/nushell-prophet-manuals/blob/main/manuals/01-install-nushell-macos/manual.md
```

**Important:** Do not include other external links (Node.js docs, official setup guides, etc.) in the YouTube description. All necessary links should be in the full manual, which we want to encourage viewers to read.

### 3. What You'll Learn Section (Recommended)
Use the üîß emoji followed by "What You'll Learn:" and bullet points listing:
- Main topics covered
- Key skills or knowledge gained
- Important configuration steps

Example:
```
üîß What You'll Learn:
- Installing VS Code text editor
- Setting up Homebrew package manager
- Installing Nushell via Homebrew
```

### 4. Prerequisites Section (If Applicable)
Use the üìù emoji followed by "Prerequisites:" and list:
- Required OS/software versions
- Prior knowledge needed (or state "No prior X experience needed!")
- Hardware requirements if relevant

### 5. Why/Context Section (Optional)
Use the üí° emoji to provide context:
- Explain the reasoning behind certain choices
- Highlight best practices being followed
- Provide additional motivation for viewers

### 6. Call-to-Action (Required)
Include standard engagement prompts:
```
üëç Like this video if you found it helpful!
üîî Subscribe for more Nushell tutorials and shell scripting content!
üí¨ Questions? Drop them in the comments below!
```

### 7. Hashtags (Required)
End with relevant hashtags (typically 5-8):
- Include #nushell for all Nushell-related content
- Add platform tags (#macos, #linux, etc.)
- Include topic tags (#terminal, #shell, #tutorial, #programming)
- Add specific tool tags when relevant (#claudecode, #ai, etc.)

## Style Guidelines

### Tone
- Friendly and approachable
- Clear and direct
- Encouraging for beginners
- Professional but not overly formal

### Formatting
- Use emojis strategically for visual scanning (don't overuse)
- Break content into clear sections
- Use bullet points for lists
- Keep paragraphs short and readable

### Language
- Write in clear, simple English
- Avoid jargon unless necessary (and explain when used)
- Use active voice
- Be specific rather than vague

### Length
- Aim for 150-300 words (before links and hashtags)
- Include enough detail to be informative
- Keep it concise enough that viewers will read it

## Variations by Content Type

### Installation/Setup Tutorials
Focus on:
- Clear step-by-step overview
- Prerequisites
- What gets installed/configured
- Why certain choices are made

### Feature/Usage Tutorials
Focus on:
- What problem it solves
- Key features demonstrated
- Practical use cases
- Tips and best practices

### Troubleshooting/Tips Videos
Focus on:
- The problem being solved
- Who this helps
- Quick preview of the solution
- Related issues covered
